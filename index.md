## Welcome to Ayush's Website :)



Hello my name is AYUSH and Here is A short Intro about me,
I am a student and I am learning how to work with computers and everything about them, I have worked a lot with Android and PC. During these months I have also worked on extending my abilities in Coding and Android developement.

Everything I do is basically a small hobby of mine which I do when I get time.

### Coding 
Its fun loving thing for developers. I started with modding SystemUI, framework-res etc. Then decided to move on to serious programming, So started with Android deving.I learnt programming myself. How ? Everything I have learnt is something that I taught myself by using "Trial And Error".

#### Experiment
Like I said I learnt coding myself. So there have to be some experiments too, no? Yes, like building ROMS,Recoveries and testing them or releasing them for testing. I do a lot of visual experiments too, like Building Games and Trying Diffrent Codes.
